# Laravel 6 Real Estate / Venues Management with Adminpanel

Transformed [Bootstrap theme Homespace](https://colorlib.com/wp/template/homespace/) into a mini-clone of [Hirespace.com](https://hirespace.com) portal, fully manageable with adminpanel generated with [QuickAdminPanel](https://quickadminpanel.com), 
to manage all the venues, locations, event types.

Also added SEO important stuff like Articles Slugs in URLs.

This is a result of 2-hours live-coding series on Youtube: [see playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oq_b1g_JpCM&list=PLdXLsjL7A9k0HPZVGiA7WZDM9Zg0OnulJ)
